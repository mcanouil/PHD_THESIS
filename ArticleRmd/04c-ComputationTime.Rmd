## Computational time
 
Computational times are reported in Table \@ref(tab:sprof).
The time required to complete JM or TS algorithms increased linearly with sample size in our simulations. 
However, these times are very optimistic since our simulations did not include any covariate or more complex random parameters. 
The main issue appears within the "_jointmodel_" function which took over 95% of the global computation time (Supplementary Figure S\@ref(fig:ProflingJM)). 
After examination of the call tree diagram, we observe that the more time-consuming task within the "_jointmodel_" function happens during the optimisation of the EM algorithm (described in @rizopoulos_joint_2012, Appendix B), despite the use of a calculation trick (i.e. adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature for numerical integration).
