	abstract = {To extend understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a meta-analysis of genetic variants on the Metabochip involving 34,840 cases and 114,981 controls, overwhelmingly of European descent. We identified ten previously unreported T2D susceptibility loci, including two demonstrating sex-differentiated association. Genome-wide analyses of these data are consistent with a long tail of further common variant loci explaining much of the variation in susceptibility to T2D. Exploration of the enlarged set of susceptibility loci implicates several processes, including CREBBP-related transcription, adipocytokine signalling and cell cycle regulation, in diabetes pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Circulating glucose levels are tightly regulated. To identify novel glycemic loci, we performed meta-analyses of 21 genome-wide associations studies informative for fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI) and indices of β-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to 46,186 non-diabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558 additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with FG/HOMA-B and two associated with FI/HOMA-IR. These include nine new FG loci (in or near ADCY5, MADD, ADRA2A, CRY2, FADS1, GLIS3, SLC2A2, PROX1 and FAM148B) and one influencing FI/HOMA-IR (near IGF1). We also demonstrated association of ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR and DGKB/TMEM195 with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Within these loci, likely biological candidate genes influence signal transduction, cell proliferation, development, glucose-sensing and circadian regulation. Our results demonstrate that genetic studies of glycemic traits can identify T2D risk loci, as well as loci that elevate FG modestly, but do not cause overt diabetes.},

These include a second independent signal at the KCNQ1 locus; the first report, to our knowledge, of an X-chromosomal association (near DUSP9); and a further instance of overlap between loci implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes (at HNF1A). The identified loci affect both beta-cell function and insulin action, and, overall, T2D association signals show evidence of enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. We also show that a high proportion of T2D susceptibility loci harbor independent association signals influencing apparently unrelated complex traits.},

Loci influencing fasting insulin showed association with lipid levels and fat distribution, suggesting impact on insulin resistance. Gene-based analyses identified further biologically plausible loci, suggesting that additional loci beyond those reaching genome-wide significance are likely to represent real associations.

	abstract = {Many longitudinal cohort studies have both genome-wide measures of genetic variation and repeated measures of phenotypes and environmental exposures. Genome-wide association study analyses have typically used only cross-sectional data to evaluate quantitative phenotypes and binary traits. Incorporation of repeated measures may increase power to detect associations, but also requires specialized analysis methods. Here, we discuss one such method—generalized estimating equations (GEE)—in the contexts of analysis of main effects of rare genetic variants and analysis of gene-environment interactions. We illustrate the potential for increased power using GEE analyses instead of cross-sectional analyses. We also address challenges that arise, such as the need for small-sample corrections when the minor allele frequency of a genetic variant and/or the prevalence of an environmental exposure is low. To illustrate methods for detection of gene-drug interactions on a genome-wide scale, using repeated measures data, we conduct single-study analyses and meta-analyses across studies in three large cohort studies participating in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium—the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Rotterdam Study.

Research over the past 5 years has taken the total number of genetic loci implicated in T2D susceptibility beyond 60, and the emphasis is now shifting to the translation of these genetic insights into clinical value. Clinical translation may flow from the identification of novel therapeutic targets, but opportunities also exist with respect to individual prediction, diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic optimization. To date, the main clinical impact has been seen for relatively rare, monogenic forms of diabetes rather than common T2D. However, the advent of high throughput sequencing approaches may herald discovery of rare and low frequency variants that offer greater translational potential.},

	abstract = {The analysis of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data using longitudinal phenotypes offers a potentially rich resource for the examination of the genetic variants and their covariates that affect complex phenotypes over time. We summarize eight contributions to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18, which applied a diverse array of statistical genetic methods to analyze WGS data in combination with data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from up to four different time points on blood pressure phenotypes. The common goal of these analyses was to develop and apply appropriate methods that utilize longitudinal repeated measures to potentially increase the analytic efficiency of WGS and GWAS data. These diverse methods can be grouped into two categories, based on the way they model dependence structures: (1) linear mixed-effects (LME) models, where the random effect terms in the linear models are used to capture the dependence structures; and (2) variance-components models, where the dependence structures are constructed directly based on multiple components of variance-covariance matrices for the multivariate Gaussian responses. Despite the heterogeneous nature of these analytical methods, the group came to the following conclusions: (1) the use of repeat measurements can gain power to identify variants associated with the phenotype; (2) the inclusion of family data may correct genotyping errors and allow for more accurate detection of rare variants than using unrelated individuals only; and (3) fitting mixed-effects and variance-components models for longitudinal data presents computational challenges. The challenges and computational burden demanded by WGS data were addressed in the eight contributions.},

Many SNPs have been identified for cross-sectionally measured phenotypes. However, there is a growing interest in genetic determinants of the evolution of traits over time. Dealing with correlated observations from the same individual, we need to apply advanced statistical techniques. The linear mixed model is popular but also much more computationally demanding than fitting a linear regression model to independent observations. We propose a conditional two-step approach as an approximate method to explore the longitudinal relationship between the trait and the SNP. In a simulation study, we compare several fast methods with respect to their accuracy and speed. The conditional two-step approach is applied to relate SNPs to longitudinal bone mineral density responses collected in the Rotterdam Study. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Analysis of genome-wide association studies with longitudinal data using standard procedures, such as linear mixed model (LMM) fitting, leads to discouragingly long computation times. There is a need to speed up the computations significantly. In our previous work (Sikorska et al: Fast linear mixed model computations for genome-wide association studies with longitudinal data. Stat Med 2012; 32.1: 165–180), we proposed the conditional two-step (CTS) approach as a fast method providing an approximation to the P-value for the longitudinal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effect. In the first step a reduced conditional LMM is fit, omitting all the SNP terms. In the second step, the estimated random slopes are regressed on SNPs. The CTS has been applied to the bone mineral density data from the Rotterdam Study and proved to work very well even in unbalanced situations. In another article (Sikorska et al: GWAS on your notebook: fast semi-parallel linear and logistic regression for genome-wide association studies. BMC Bioinformatics 2013; 14: 166), we suggested semi-parallel computations, greatly speeding up fitting many linear regressions. Combining CTS with fast linear regression reduces the computation time from several weeks to a few minutes on a single computer. Here, we explore further the properties of the CTS both analytically and by simulations. We investigate the performance of our proposal in comparison with a related but different approach, the two-step procedure. It is analytically shown that for the balanced case, under mild assumptions, the P-value provided by the CTS is the same as from the LMM. For unbalanced data and in realistic situations, simulations show that the CTS method does not inflate the type I error rate and implies only a minimal loss of power.},

The covariates may change their values over time. This article discusses the use of such time-dependent covariates, which offer additional opportunities but must be used with caution. The interrelationships between the outcome and variable over time can lead to bias unless the relationships are well understood. The form of a time-dependent covariate is much more complex than in Cox models with fixed (non-time-dependent) covariates. It involves constructing a function of time. Further, the model does not have some of the properties of the fixed-covariate model; it cannot usually be used to predict the survival (time-to-event) curve over time. The estimated probability of an event over time is not related to the hazard function in the usual fashion. An appendix summarizes the mathematics of time-dependent covariates.},

These results motivate two central questions: (1) can further genetic investigation identify additional associated regions?; and (2) can more detailed genetic investigation help us identify the causal variants (or variants more strongly correlated with the causal variants) in the regions identified so far? Addressing these questions requires assaying many genetic variants in DNA samples from thousands of individuals, which is expensive and timeconsuming when done a few SNPs at a time. To facilitate these investigations, we designed the “Metabochip,” a custom genotyping array that assays variation in nearly 200,000 sites in the human genome. Here we describe the Metabochip, evaluate its performance in assaying human genetic variation, and describe solutions to methodological challenges commonly encountered in its analysis.},
