	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have shown that variation in MTNR1B (melatonin receptor 1B) is associated with insulin and glucose concentrations. Here we show that the risk genotype of this SNP predicts future type 2 diabetes (T2D) in two large prospective studies. Specifically, the risk genotype was associated with impairment of early insulin response to both oral and intravenous glucose and with faster deterioration of insulin secretion over time. We also show that the MTNR1B mRNA is expressed in human islets, and immunocytochemistry confirms that it is primarily localized in cells in islets. Nondiabetic individuals carrying the risk allele and individuals with T2D showed increased expression of the receptor in islets. Insulin release from clonal cells in response to glucose was inhibited in the presence of melatonin. These data suggest that the circulating hormone melatonin, which is predominantly released from the pineal gland in the brain, is involved in the pathogenesis of T2D. Given the increased expression of MTNR1B in individuals at risk of T2D, the pathogenic effects are likely exerted via a direct inhibitory effect on cells. In view of these results, blocking the melatonin ligand-receptor system could be a therapeutic avenue in T2D.},

In European populations, the rs1387153 T allele is associated with increased FPG ( = 0.06 mmol/l, P = 7.6 10-29, N = 16,094), type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95\% CI = 1.08–1.22, P = 6.3 10-5, cases N = 6,332) and risk of developing hyperglycemia or diabetes over a 9-year period (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.20, 95\% CI = 1.06–1.36, P = 0.005, incident cases N = 515). RT-PCR analyses confirm the presence of MT2 transcripts in neural tissues and show MT2 expression in human pancreatic islets and beta cells.

	abstract = {A joint model based on a latent class approach is proposed to explore the association between correlated longitudinal quantitative markers and a time-to-event. A longitudinal latent class model describes latent profiles of evolution of the latent process underlying the correlated markers. The latent process is linked to the markers by nonlinear transformations including parameters to be estimated. A proportional hazard model describes the joint risk of event according to the latent classes and two specifications of the risk function are considered: a parametric function and a semi-parametric function based on splines. Depending on the chosen risk function, estimation is performed by a maximum likelihood or a maximum penalized likelihood approach. A simulation study validates the estimation procedure. As a latent class model relies on the strong assumption that the markers and the time-to-event are independent conditionally on the latent classes, a test of conditional independence is proposed using the residuals conditional on time-to-event. The procedure does not require any posterior classification and can be conducted using standard statistical softwares. The methodology is applied to describe profiles of cognitive decline in the elderly and their associated risk of dementia.},

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis Genome-wide association studies have firmly established 65 independent European-derived loci associated with type 2 diabetes and 36 loci contributing to variations in fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Using individual data from the Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) prospective study, we evaluated the contribution of three genetic risk scores (GRS) to variations in metabolic traits, and to the incidence and prevalence of impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) and type 2 diabetes. Methods Three GRS (GRS-1, 65 type 2 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]; GRS-2, GRS-1 combined with 24 FPG-raising SNPs; and GRS-3, FPG-raising SNPs alone) were analysed in 4,075 DESIR study participants. GRS-mediated effects on longitudinal variations in quantitative traits were assessed in 3,927 nondiabetic individuals using multivariate linear mixed models, and on the incidence and prevalence of hyperglycaemia at 9 years using Cox and logistic regression models. The contribution of each GRS to risk prediction was evaluated using the C-statistic and net reclassification improvement (NRI) analysis. Results The two most inclusive GRS were significantly associated with increased FPG (β = 0.0011 mmol/l per year per risk allele, p GRS-1 = 8.2 × 10−5 and p GRS-2 = 6.0 × 10−6), increased incidence of IFG and type 2 diabetes (per allele: HR GRS-1 1.03, p = 4.3 × 10−9 and HR GRS-2 1.04, p = 1.0 × 10−16), and the 9 year prevalence (OR GRS-1 1.13 [95\% CI 1.10, 1.17], p = 1.9 × 10−14 for type 2 diabetes only; OR GRS-2 1.07 [95\% CI 1.05, 1.08], p = 7.8 × 10−25, for IFG and type 2 diabetes). No significant interaction was found between GRS-1 or GRS-2 and potential confounding factors. Each GRS yielded a modest, but significant, improvement in overall reclassification rates (NRI GRS-1 17.3\%, p = 6.6 × 10−7; NRI GRS-2 17.6\%, p = 4.2 × 10−7; NRI GRS-3 13.1\%, p = 1.7 × 10−4). Conclusions/interpretation Polygenic scores based on combined genetic information from type 2 diabetes risk and FPG variation contribute to discriminating middle-aged individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes in a general population.},

	abstract = {Circulating glucose levels are tightly regulated. To identify novel glycemic loci, we performed meta-analyses of 21 genome-wide associations studies informative for fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI) and indices of β-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to 46,186 non-diabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558 additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with FG/HOMA-B and two associated with FI/HOMA-IR. These include nine new FG loci (in or near ADCY5, MADD, ADRA2A, CRY2, FADS1, GLIS3, SLC2A2, PROX1 and FAM148B) and one influencing FI/HOMA-IR (near IGF1). We also demonstrated association of ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR and DGKB/TMEM195 with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Within these loci, likely biological candidate genes influence signal transduction, cell proliferation, development, glucose-sensing and circadian regulation. Our results demonstrate that genetic studies of glycemic traits can identify T2D risk loci, as well as loci that elevate FG modestly, but do not cause overt diabetes.},

These include a second independent signal at the KCNQ1 locus; the first report, to our knowledge, of an X-chromosomal association (near DUSP9); and a further instance of overlap between loci implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes (at HNF1A). The identified loci affect both beta-cell function and insulin action, and, overall, T2D association signals show evidence of enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. We also show that a high proportion of T2D susceptibility loci harbor independent association signals influencing apparently unrelated complex traits.},

	abstract = {Owing to the rapid development of biomarkers in clinical trials, joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has gained its popularity in the recent years because it reduces bias and provides improvements of efficiency in the assessment of treatment effects and other prognostic factors. Although much effort has been put into inferential methods in joint modeling, such as estimation and hypothesis testing, design aspects have not been formally considered. Statistical design, such as sample size and power calculations, is a crucial first step in clinical trials. In this paper, we derive a closed-form sample size formula for estimating the effect of the longitudinal process in joint modeling, and extend Schoenfeld's sample size formula to the joint modeling setting for estimating the overall treatment effect. The sample size formula we develop is quite general, allowing for p-degree polynomial trajectories. The robustness of our model is demonstrated in simulation studies with linear and quadratic trajectories. We discuss the impact of the within-subject variability on power and data collection strategies, such as spacing and frequency of repeated measurements, in order to maximize the power. When the within-subject variability is large, different data collection strategies can influence the power of the study in a significant way. Optimal frequency of repeated measurements also depends on the nature of the trajectory with higher polynomial trajectories and larger measurement error requiring more frequent measurements.

Loci influencing fasting insulin showed association with lipid levels and fat distribution, suggesting impact on insulin resistance. Gene-based analyses identified further biologically plausible loci, suggesting that additional loci beyond those reaching genome-wide significance are likely to represent real associations.

Functional follow-up of these newly discovered loci will further improve our understanding of glycemic control.},

	abstract = {Many longitudinal cohort studies have both genome-wide measures of genetic variation and repeated measures of phenotypes and environmental exposures. Genome-wide association study analyses have typically used only cross-sectional data to evaluate quantitative phenotypes and binary traits. Incorporation of repeated measures may increase power to detect associations, but also requires specialized analysis methods. Here, we discuss one such method—generalized estimating equations (GEE)—in the contexts of analysis of main effects of rare genetic variants and analysis of gene-environment interactions. We illustrate the potential for increased power using GEE analyses instead of cross-sectional analyses. We also address challenges that arise, such as the need for small-sample corrections when the minor allele frequency of a genetic variant and/or the prevalence of an environmental exposure is low. To illustrate methods for detection of gene-drug interactions on a genome-wide scale, using repeated measures data, we conduct single-study analyses and meta-analyses across studies in three large cohort studies participating in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium—the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Rotterdam Study.

Research over the past 5 years has taken the total number of genetic loci implicated in T2D susceptibility beyond 60, and the emphasis is now shifting to the translation of these genetic insights into clinical value. Clinical translation may flow from the identification of novel therapeutic targets, but opportunities also exist with respect to individual prediction, diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic optimization. To date, the main clinical impact has been seen for relatively rare, monogenic forms of diabetes rather than common T2D. However, the advent of high throughput sequencing approaches may herald discovery of rare and low frequency variants that offer greater translational potential.},

	abstract = {The analysis of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data using longitudinal phenotypes offers a potentially rich resource for the examination of the genetic variants and their covariates that affect complex phenotypes over time. We summarize eight contributions to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18, which applied a diverse array of statistical genetic methods to analyze WGS data in combination with data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from up to four different time points on blood pressure phenotypes. The common goal of these analyses was to develop and apply appropriate methods that utilize longitudinal repeated measures to potentially increase the analytic efficiency of WGS and GWAS data. These diverse methods can be grouped into two categories, based on the way they model dependence structures: (1) linear mixed-effects (LME) models, where the random effect terms in the linear models are used to capture the dependence structures; and (2) variance-components models, where the dependence structures are constructed directly based on multiple components of variance-covariance matrices for the multivariate Gaussian responses. Despite the heterogeneous nature of these analytical methods, the group came to the following conclusions: (1) the use of repeat measurements can gain power to identify variants associated with the phenotype; (2) the inclusion of family data may correct genotyping errors and allow for more accurate detection of rare variants than using unrelated individuals only; and (3) fitting mixed-effects and variance-components models for longitudinal data presents computational challenges. The challenges and computational burden demanded by WGS data were addressed in the eight contributions.},

Many SNPs have been identified for cross-sectionally measured phenotypes. However, there is a growing interest in genetic determinants of the evolution of traits over time. Dealing with correlated observations from the same individual, we need to apply advanced statistical techniques. The linear mixed model is popular but also much more computationally demanding than fitting a linear regression model to independent observations. We propose a conditional two-step approach as an approximate method to explore the longitudinal relationship between the trait and the SNP. In a simulation study, we compare several fast methods with respect to their accuracy and speed. The conditional two-step approach is applied to relate SNPs to longitudinal bone mineral density responses collected in the Rotterdam Study. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Analysis of genome-wide association studies with longitudinal data using standard procedures, such as linear mixed model (LMM) fitting, leads to discouragingly long computation times. There is a need to speed up the computations significantly. In our previous work (Sikorska et al: Fast linear mixed model computations for genome-wide association studies with longitudinal data. Stat Med 2012; 32.1: 165–180), we proposed the conditional two-step (CTS) approach as a fast method providing an approximation to the P-value for the longitudinal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effect. In the first step a reduced conditional LMM is fit, omitting all the SNP terms. In the second step, the estimated random slopes are regressed on SNPs. The CTS has been applied to the bone mineral density data from the Rotterdam Study and proved to work very well even in unbalanced situations. In another article (Sikorska et al: GWAS on your notebook: fast semi-parallel linear and logistic regression for genome-wide association studies. BMC Bioinformatics 2013; 14: 166), we suggested semi-parallel computations, greatly speeding up fitting many linear regressions. Combining CTS with fast linear regression reduces the computation time from several weeks to a few minutes on a single computer. Here, we explore further the properties of the CTS both analytically and by simulations. We investigate the performance of our proposal in comparison with a related but different approach, the two-step procedure. It is analytically shown that for the balanced case, under mild assumptions, the P-value provided by the CTS is the same as from the LMM. For unbalanced data and in realistic situations, simulations show that the CTS method does not inflate the type I error rate and implies only a minimal loss of power.},

The covariates may change their values over time. This article discusses the use of such time-dependent covariates, which offer additional opportunities but must be used with caution. The interrelationships between the outcome and variable over time can lead to bias unless the relationships are well understood. The form of a time-dependent covariate is much more complex than in Cox models with fixed (non-time-dependent) covariates. It involves constructing a function of time. Further, the model does not have some of the properties of the fixed-covariate model; it cannot usually be used to predict the survival (time-to-event) curve over time. The estimated probability of an event over time is not related to the hazard function in the usual fashion. An appendix summarizes the mathematics of time-dependent covariates.},

These results motivate two central questions: (1) can further genetic investigation identify additional associated regions?; and (2) can more detailed genetic investigation help us identify the causal variants (or variants more strongly correlated with the causal variants) in the regions identified so far? Addressing these questions requires assaying many genetic variants in DNA samples from thousands of individuals, which is expensive and timeconsuming when done a few SNPs at a time. To facilitate these investigations, we designed the “Metabochip,” a custom genotyping array that assays variation in nearly 200,000 sites in the human genome. Here we describe the Metabochip, evaluate its performance in assaying human genetic variation, and describe solutions to methodological challenges commonly encountered in its analysis.},
