	abstract = {Longitudinal data enables detecting the effect of aging/time, and as a repeated measures design is statistically more efficient compared to cross-sectional data if the correlations between repeated measurements are not large. In particular, when genotyping cost is more expensive than phenotyping cost, the collection of longitudinal data can be an efficient strategy for genetic association analysis. However, in spite of these advantages, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with longitudinal data have rarely been analyzed taking this into account. In this report, we calculate the required sample size to achieve 80\% power at the genome-wide significance level for both longitudinal and  cross-sectional data, and compare their statistical efficiency. Furthermore, we analyzed the GWAS of eight phenotypes with three observations on each individual in the Korean Association Resource (KARE). A linear mixed model allowing for the correlations between observations for each individual was applied to analyze the longitudinal data, and linear regression was used to analyze the first observation on each individual as  cross-sectional data. We found 12 novel genome-wide significant disease susceptibility loci that were then confirmed in the Health Examination cohort, as well as some significant interactions between age/sex and SNPs.},

	abstract = {Most complex human diseases are likely the consequence of the joint actions of genetic and environmental factors. Identification of gene-environment (G × E) interactions not only contributes to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms, but also improves disease risk prediction and targeted intervention. In contrast to the large number of genetic susceptibility loci discovered by genome-wide association studies, there have been very few successes in identifying G × E interactions, which may be partly due to limited statistical power and inaccurately measured exposures. Although existing statistical methods only consider interactions between genes and static environmental exposures, many environmental/lifestyle factors, such as air pollution and diet, change over time, and cannot be accurately captured at one measurement time point or by simply categorizing into static exposure categories. There is a dearth of statistical methods for detecting gene by time-varying environmental exposure interactions. Here, we propose a powerful functional logistic regression (FLR) approach to model the time-varying effect of longitudinal environmental exposure and its interaction with genetic factors on disease risk. Capitalizing on the powerful functional data analysis framework, our proposed FLR model is capable of accommodating longitudinal exposures measured at irregular time points and contaminated by measurement errors, commonly encountered in observational studies. We use extensive simulations to show that the proposed method can control the Type I error and is more powerful than alternative ad hoc methods. We demonstrate the utility of this new method using data from a case-control study of pancreatic cancer to identify the windows of vulnerability of lifetime body mass index on the risk of pancreatic cancer as well as genes that may modify this association.},

	abstract = {AbstractGenome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering novel genetic variants that are associated with disease status or cross-sectional phenotypic traits. Researchers are beginning to investigate how genes play a role in the development of a trait over time. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) are commonly used to model longitudinal data; however, it is unclear if the failure to meet the models distributional assumptions will affect the conclusions when conducting a genome-wide association study. In an extensive simulation study, we compare coverage probabilities, bias, type 1 error rates and statistical power when the error of the LMM is either heteroscedastic or has a non-Gaussian distribution. We conclude that the model is robust to misspecification if the same function of age is included in the fixed and random effects. However, type 1 error of the genetic effect over time is inflated, regardless of the model misspecification, if the polynomial function for age in the fixed and random effects differs. In situations where the model will not converge with a high order polynomial function in the random effects, a reduced function can be used but a robust standard error needs to be calculated to avoid inflation of the type 1 error. As an illustration, a LMM was applied to longitudinal body mass index (BMI) data over childhood in the ALSPAC cohort; the results emphasised the need for the robust standard error to ensure correct inference of associations of longitudinal BMI with chromosome 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms.},

The effect of a haplotype can be expressed by time-varying coefficients. In this paper, we use the natural cubic B-spline to express these coefficients that capture the trends of the effects of haplotypes, some of which may be rare, over time; that is, at different ages. More specifically, to capture disease-associated common and rare haplotypes and environmental factors for data from unrelated individuals, we developed a method of time-varying coefficients that uses the logistic Bayesian LASSO methodology and B-spline by setting proper prior distributions. Haplotype and environmental effect coefficients are obtained by using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We applied the method to analyze the MAP4 gene on chromosome 3 and have identified several haplotypes that are associated with hypertension with varying effect sizes in the range of 55 to 85 years of age.},

	abstract = {Genetic association analysis on complex phenotypes under a longitudinal design involving pedigrees encounters the problem of correlation within pedigrees, which could affect statistical assessment of the genetic effects. Approaches have been proposed to integrate kinship correlation into the mixed-effect models to explicitly model the genetic relationship. These have proved to be an efficient way of dealing with sample clustering in pedigree data. Although current algorithms implemented in popular statistical packages are useful for adjusting relatedness in the mixed modeling of genetic effects on the mean level of a phenotype, they are not sufficiently straightforward to handle the kinship correlation on the time-dependent trajectories of a phenotype. We introduce a 2-level hierarchical linear model to separately assess the genetic associations with the mean level and the rate of change of a phenotype, integrating kinship correlation in the analysis. We apply our method to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 genome-wide association studies data on chromosome 3 to estimate the genetic effects on systolic blood pressure measured over time in large pedigrees. Our method identifies genetic variants associated with blood pressure with estimated inflation factors of 0.99, suggesting that our modeling of random effects efficiently handles the genetic relatedness in pedigrees. Application to simulated data captures important variants specified in the simulation. Our results show that the method is useful for genetic association studies in related samples using longitudinal design.},

To test the null hypothesis of no association, a multivariate Wald test was applied. We analyzed the simulated data sets to assess the performance of the method.

First we carried out agenome-wide association study (GWAS) using chromosome 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) to identify regions associated with SBP levels. In a second step, we examined the sequence data to fine-map additional variants in these regions. Four SNPs from two intergenic regions (PLXNA1-TPRA1, BPESC1-PISTR1) and one gene (NLGN1) were detected to be significantly associated with SBP after adjusting for multiple testing. These SNPs were used to capture the multilocus genotype diversity in the regions. The multilocus genotypes derived from these four variants were then treated as random effects in the mixed-effects model, and the corresponding confidence intervals (Cis) were built to assess the significance of the joint effect of the sequence variants on SBP. We found that multilocus genotypes (GG,TT,AG,GG), (GG,TT,GG,GG), and (GG,TT,AA,AG) are associated with higher SBPand (GG,CT,AA,AA), (AA,TT,AA,AA), and (AG,CT,AA,AG) are associated with lower SBP. The linear mixed-effects models provide a powerful tool for GWAS and the analysis of joint modeling of multilocus genotypes.},

All methods accounted for the familial correlation among subjects within a pedigree. The analyses considered common variants with minor allele frequency above 5\% on chromosome 3. Analyses were performed without knowledge of the simulation model. The 3 longitudinal methods showed consistent results, which were generally different from those found by using only the baseline observation. The gene CACNA2D3, identified by both longitudinal and baseline approaches, had a stronger signal in the longitudinal analysis (p = 2.65 × 10−7) compared to that in the baseline analysis (p = 2.48 × 10−5).

In WGS, family-based studies are important because they are likely enriched for rare disease variants that segregate with the disease in relatives. We propose a multilevel model to detect disease variants using family-based WGS data with longitudinal measures. This model incorporates the correlation structure from family pedigrees and that from repeated measures. The iterative generalized least squares algorithm was applied to estimation of parameters and test of associations. The model was applied to the data of Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 and compared with existing linear mixed-effect models. The multilevel model shows higher power at practical p-value levels and a better type I error control than linear mixed-effect model. Both multilevel and linear mixed-effect models, which use the longitudinal repeated information, have higher power than the methods that only use data collected at one time point.},

	abstract = {Many longitudinal cohort studies have both genome-wide measures of genetic variation and repeated measures of phenotypes and environmental exposures. Genome-wide association study analyses have typically used only cross-sectional data to evaluate quantitative phenotypes and binary traits. Incorporation of repeated measures may increase power to detect associations, but also requires specialized analysis methods. Here, we discuss one such method—generalized estimating equations (GEE)—in the contexts of analysis of main effects of rare genetic variants and analysis of gene-environment interactions. We illustrate the potential for increased power using GEE analyses instead of cross-sectional analyses. We also address challenges that arise, such as the need for small-sample corrections when the minor allele frequency of a genetic variant and/or the prevalence of an environmental exposure is low. To illustrate methods for detection of gene-drug interactions on a genome-wide scale, using repeated measures data, we conduct single-study analyses and meta-analyses across studies in three large cohort studies participating in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium—the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Rotterdam Study.

In this article, as a case study, we conducted both longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of the ADNI data with several brain imaging (not clinical diagnosis) phenotypes, demonstrating the power gains of longitudinal analysis over cross-sectional analysis. Specifically, we scanned genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 56 brain-wide imaging phenotypes processed by FreeSurfer on 638 subjects. At the genome-wide significance level () or a less stringent level (e.g. ), longitudinal analysis of the phenotypic data from the baseline to month 48 identified more SNP-phenotype associations than cross-sectional analysis of only the baseline data. In particular, at the genome-wide significance level, both SNP rs429358 in gene APOE and SNP rs2075650 in gene TOMM40 were confirmed to be associated with various imaging phenotypes in multiple regions of interests (ROIs) by both analyses, though longitudinal analysis detected more regional phenotypes associated with the two SNPs and indicated another significant SNP rs439401 in gene APOE. In light of the power advantage of longitudinal analysis, we advocate its use in current and future longitudinal neuroimaging studies.},

We summarize eight contributions to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18, which applied a diverse array of statistical genetic methods to analyze WGS data in combination with data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from up to four different time points on blood pressure phenotypes. The common goal of these analyses was to develop and apply appropriate methods that utilize longitudinal repeated measures to potentially increase the analytic efficiency of WGS and GWAS data. These diverse methods can be grouped into two categories, based on the way they model dependence structures: (1) linear mixed-effects (LME) models, where the random effect terms in the linear models are used to capture the dependence structures; and (2) variance-components models, where the dependence structures are constructed directly based on multiple components of variance-covariance matrices for the multivariate Gaussian responses. Despite the heterogeneous nature of these analytical methods, the group came to the following conclusions: (1) the use of repeat measurements can gain power to identify variants associated with the phenotype; (2) the inclusion of family data may correct genotyping errors and allow for more accurate detection of rare variants than using unrelated individuals only; and (3) fitting mixed-effects and variance-components models for longitudinal data presents computational challenges. The challenges and computational burden demanded by WGS data were addressed in the eight contributions.},

Dealing with correlated observations from the same individual, we need to apply advanced statistical techniques. The linear mixed model is popular but also much more computationally demanding than fitting a linear regression model to independent observations. We propose a conditional two-step approach as an approximate method to explore the longitudinal relationship between the trait and the SNP.

Moreover, we show that by using this model we are able to differentiate the genetic, environmental, and residual error contributions to the phenotype. Using predictions of these components, we show how the proportion of the phenotype due to environment and genetics can be predicted and show that the ranking of individuals based on these predictions is very accurate.

There is a need to speed up the computations significantly. In our previous work (Sikorska et al: Fast linear mixed model computations for genome-wide association studies with longitudinal data. Stat Med 2012; 32.1: 165–180), we proposed the conditional two-step (CTS) approach as a fast method providing an approximation to the P-value for the longitudinal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effect. In the first step a reduced conditional LMM is fit, omitting all the SNP terms. In the second step, the estimated random slopes are regressed on SNPs. The CTS has been applied to the bone mineral density data from the Rotterdam Study and proved to work very well even in unbalanced situations. In another article (Sikorska et al: GWAS on your notebook: fast semi-parallel linear and logistic regression for genome-wide association studies. BMC Bioinformatics 2013; 14: 166), we suggested semi-parallel computations, greatly speeding up fitting many linear regressions. Combining CTS with fast linear regression reduces the computation time from several weeks to a few minutes on a single computer. Here, we explore further the properties of the CTS both analytically and by simulations. We investigate the performance of our proposal in comparison with a related but different approach, the two-step procedure. It is analytically shown that for the balanced case, under mild assumptions, the P-value provided by the CTS is the same as from the LMM. For unbalanced data and in realistic situations, simulations show that the CTS method does not inflate the type I error rate and implies only a minimal loss of power.},

Although the pattern of missing data can be assessed during data analysis, it is unknown during the design phase of a study. The random nature of the missing data pattern adds another layer of complexity in addressing missing data for power analysis. In this paper, we model the occurrence of missing data with a two-state, first-order Markov process and integrate the modelling information into the power function to account for random missing data patterns. The Markov model is easily specified to accommodate different anticipated missing data processes. We develop this approach for the two most popular longitudinal models: the generalized estimating equations (GEE) and the linear mixed-effects model under the missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption. For GEE, we also limit our consideration to the working independence correlation model. The proposed methodology is illustrated with numerous examples that are motivated by real study designs.

In this paper, we show by simulated studies that in the presence of missing data estimates of the fixed effect of LMM are biased under departures from normality. We discuss two robust alternatives, the weighted generalized estimating equations (WGEE) and the augmented WGEE (AWGEE), and compare their performances with LMM using real as well as simulated data.

We review the rationale for and development of joint models, offer insight into the structure of the likelihood for model parameters that clarifies the nature of common assumptions, and describe and contrast some of our recent proposals for implementation and inference.},

	abstract = {Owing to the rapid development of biomarkers in clinical trials, joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has gained its popularity in the recent years because it reduces bias and provides improvements of efficiency in the assessment of treatment effects and other prognostic factors. Although much effort has been put into inferential methods in joint modeling, such as estimation and hypothesis testing, design aspects have not been formally considered. Statistical design, such as sample size and power calculations, is a crucial first step in clinical trials. In this paper, we derive a closed-form sample size formula for estimating the effect of the longitudinal process in joint modeling, and extend Schoenfeld's sample size formula to the joint modeling setting for estimating the overall treatment effect. The sample size formula we develop is quite general, allowing for p-degree polynomial trajectories. The robustness of our model is demonstrated in simulation studies with linear and quadratic trajectories. We discuss the impact of the within-subject variability on power and data collection strategies, such as spacing and frequency of repeated measurements, in order to maximize the power. When the within-subject variability is large, different data collection strategies can influence the power of the study in a significant way. Optimal frequency of repeated measurements also depends on the nature of the trajectory with higher polynomial trajectories and larger measurement error requiring more frequent measurements.

Here, we describe a novel statistical approach, called functional GWAS or fGWAS, to analyze the genetic control of traits by integrating biological principles of trait formation into the GWAS framework through mathematical and statistical bridges. fGWAS can address many fundamental questions, such as the patterns of genetic control over development, the duration of genetic effects, as well as what causes developmental trajectories to change or stop changing. In statistics, fGWAS displays increased power for gene detection by capitalizing on cumulative phenotypic variation in a longitudinal trait over time and increased robustness for manipulating sparse longitudinal data.},

	abstract = {Various studies have linked different genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to different blood lipids (BL), but whether these “connections” were identified using cross-sectional or longitudinal (i.e., changes over time) designs has received little attention. Cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments of BL [total, high-, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC, HDL, LDL), triglycerides (TG)] and non-genetic factors (body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake) were measured for 2,002 Geneva, Switzerland, adults during 1999–2008 (two measurements, median 6 years apart), and 20 SNPs in 13 BL metabolism-related genes. Fixed and mixed effects repeated measures linear regression models, respectively, were employed to identify cross-sectional and longitudinal SNP:BL associations among the 1,516 (76\%) study participants who reported not being treated for hypercholesterolemia at either measurement time. One-third more (12 vs. 9) longitudinal than cross-sectional associations were found [Bonferroni-adjusted two-tailed p {\textless} 0.00125 (=0.05/2)/20) for each of the four ensembles of 20 SNP:individual BL associations tested under the two study designs]. There was moderate consistency between the cross-sectional and longitudinal findings, with eight SNP:BL associations consistently identified across both study designs: [APOE.2 and APOE.4 (rs7412 and rs429358)]:TC; HL/LIPC (rs2070895):HDL; [APOB (rs1367117), APOE.2 and APOE.4 (rs7412 and rs429358)]:LDL; [APOA5 (rs2072560) and APOC III (rs5128)]:TG. The results suggest that cross-sectional studies, which include most genome-wide association studies (GWAS), can assess the large majority of SNP:BL associations. In the present analysis, which was much less powered than a GWAS, the cross-sectional study was around 2/3 (67\%) as efficient as the longitudinal study.},

The joint implementation of these two methods markedly reduced computing time and either maintained or improved statistical power. We used simulations to demonstrate the usefulness in controlling for substructure in genetic association datasets for a range of species and genetic architectures.

Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

We have studied the association between genetic factors on a whole genome level and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in a population of individuals studied from childhood through adulthood. The longitudinal study design has enabled the investigation of genetic variation influencing trait values over time. We have identified DNA variants that are associated with CVD trait values consistently over time, and a second set of variants that are associated with CVD trait values in a time-dependent manner. We also show that variants previously identified in adult populations have consistent effects within our population and that these effects are usually similar across childhood through adulthood. The discovery of time-dependent variants that influence CVD trait values over time can potentially be used to screen young individuals who are pre-symptomatic and provide the opportunity for preventive measures decades before disease onset.},

In this study, we tested 23 genotyped GWAS-significant SNPs (p-value{\textless}5*10-8) for longitudinal associations with BMI during childhood (3–17 years) and adulthood (18–45 years) for 658 subjects. We also proposed a heuristic forward search for the best joint effect model to explain the longitudinal BMI variation. After using false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust for multiple tests, childhood and adulthood BMI were found to be significantly associated with six SNPs each (q-value{\textless}0.05), with one SNP associated with both BMI measurements: KCTD15 rs29941 (q-value{\textless}7.6*10-4). These 12 SNPs are located at or near genes either expressed in the brain (BDNF, KCTD15, TMEM18, MTCH2, and FTO) or implicated in cell apoptosis and proliferation (FAIM2, MAP2K5, and TFAP2B). The longitudinal effects of FAIM2 rs7138803 on childhood BMI and MAP2K5 rs2241423 on adulthood BMI decreased as age increased (q-value{\textless}0.05). The FTO candidate SNPs, rs6499640 at the 5 ′-end and rs1121980 and rs8050136 downstream, were associated with childhood and adulthood BMI, respectively, and the risk effects of rs6499640 and rs1121980 increased as birth weight decreased. The best joint effect model for childhood and adulthood BMI contained 14 and 15 SNPs each, with 11 in common, and the percentage of explained variance increased from 0.17\% and 9.0*10−6\% to 2.22\% and 2.71\%, respectively. In summary, this study evidenced the presence of long-term major effects of genes on obesity development, implicated in pathways related to neural development and cell metabolism, and different sets of genes associated with childhood and adulthood BMI, respectively. The gene effects can vary with age and be modified by prenatal development. The best joint effect model indicated that multiple variants with effects that are weak or absent alone can nevertheless jointly exert a large longitudinal effect on BMI.},

	abstract = {Models for the analysis of longitudinal data must recognize the relationship between serial observations on the same unit. Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the pioposecl estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 25 loci were genotyped in a large case-control sample of 10,001 subjects (5,338 T2D cases and 4,663 controls) and a prospective cohort of 1,881 Chinese. In the case-control sample, 8 SNPs in or near WFS1, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, CDC123, HHEX, TCF7L2, KCNQ1, and MTNR1B were significantly associated with T2D (P{\textless}0.05). Thirteen SNPs were associated with quantitative glycemic traits. For example, the most significant SNP, rs10811661 near CDKN2A/2B (P = 1.11×10−8 for T2D), was also associated with 2-h glucose level of an oral glucose tolerance test (P = 9.11×10−3) and insulinogenic index (P = 2.71×10−2). In the cohort study, individuals carrying more risk alleles of the replicated SNPs had greater FPG increase and T2D incidence in a 7.5-year follow-up period, with each quartile increase in the number of risk alleles being associated with a 0.06 mmol/l greater increase in FPG (P = 0.03) and 19\% higher odds of developing T2D (P = 0.058). Our study identified the associations of several established T2D-loci in Europeans with T2D and quantitative glycemic traits in the Chinese population. The prospective data also suggest their potential role in the risk prediction of T2D in the Chinese population.},

The interrelationships between the outcome and variable over time can lead to bias unless the relationships are well understood. The form of a time-dependent covariate is much more complex than in Cox models with fixed (non-time-dependent) covariates. It involves constructing a function of time. Further, the model does not have some of the properties of the fixed-covariate model; it cannot usually be used to predict the survival (time-to-event) curve over time. The estimated probability of an event over time is not related to the hazard function in the usual fashion. An appendix summarizes the mathematics of time-dependent covariates.},

	abstract = {A question that has received a great deal of attention in evaluating new treatments in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical trials is that of finding a good surrogate marker for clinical progression. The identification of such a marker may be useful in assessing the efficacy of new therapies in a shorter period. The number of CD4-lymphocyte counts has been proposed as such a potential marker for human immune virus (HIV) trials because of its observed correlation with clinical outcome. But to evaluate the role of CD4 counts as a potential surrogate marker, we must better understand the relationship of clinical outcome to an individual's CD4 count history over time. The Cox proportional hazards regression model is used to study the relationship between CD4 counts as a time-dependent covariate and survival. Because the CD4 counts are measured only periodically and with substantial measurement error and biological variation, standard methods for estimating the parameters in the Cox model by maximizing the partial likelihood are no longer appropriate. Instead, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage the longitudinal CD4 count data are modeled using a repeated measures random components model. In the second stage methods for estimating the parameters in a Cox model when the data are assumed to be of this form are derived. We also considered methods to account for missing data patterns. These methods are applied to CD4 data from a randomized clinical trial of AIDS patients where half of the patients were randomized to receive Zidovudine (ZDV) and the other half were randomized to receive a placebo. Although a strong correlation between CD4 counts and survival is demonstrated, we also show that CD4 counts may not serve as a useful surrogate marker for assessing treatments for this population of patients.},

	abstract = {In many longitudinal studies, the outcomes recorded on each subject include both a sequence of repeated measurements at pre-specified times and the time at which an event of particular interest occurs: for example, death, recurrence of symptoms or drop out from the study. The event time for each subject may be recorded exactly, interval censored or right censored. The term joint modelling refers to the statistical analysis of the resulting data while taking account of any association between the repeated measurement and time-to-event outcomes. In this paper, we first discuss different approaches to joint modelling and argue that the analysis strategy should depend on the scientific focus of the study. We then describe in detail a particularly simple, fully parametric approach. Finally, we use this approach to re-analyse data from a clinical trial of drug therapies for schizophrenic patients, in which the event time is an interval-censored or right-censored time to withdrawal from the study due to adverse side effects.

	abstract = {Markers are internal host factors that measure the current disease or recovery status of an individual. Individuals with more advanced disease progression are more likely to drop out, e.g. because they die. Marker data after dropout are missing. Such missingness is certainly not completely at random. A mixed effects model can be used if missingness of the marker data depends on measured marker values only (missing at random). If missingness is not at random, such models yield biased results. We describe various approaches that jointly model the marker development and dropout risk and may eliminate bias. One example of such a model is a random effects selection model. Based on a real data set with frequent follow-up, we compare results from a random effects model and a random effects selection model. Results are remarkably similar. In a simulation study, we investigate how the bias in the parameter estimates from a random effects model depends on the frequency of measurements and the time between the last measurement and the dropout or censoring time. Results from the simulation study confirm that the bias is small if follow-up is frequent.},

These include a second independent signal at the KCNQ1 locus; the first report, to our knowledge, of an X-chromosomal association (near DUSP9); and a further instance of overlap between loci implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes (at HNF1A). The identified loci affect both beta-cell function and insulin action, and, overall, T2D association signals show evidence of enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. We also show that a high proportion of T2D susceptibility loci harbor independent association signals influencing apparently unrelated complex traits.},

The model is motivated by data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), in which HIV+ subjects have viral load and CD4 cell count measured at repeated visits along with survival data. We model the longitudinal component using a normal linear mixed model, modeling the trajectory of CD4 cell count by regressing on viral load, and other covariates. The viral load data are subject to both left censoring because of detection limits (17\%) and intermittent missingness (27\%). The survival component of the joint model is a Cox model with time-dependent covariates for death because of AIDS. The longitudinal and survival models are linked using the trajectory function of the linear mixed model. A Bayesian analysis is conducted on the MACS data using the proposed joint model. The proposed method is shown to improve the precision of estimates when compared with alternative methods. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Joint models for longitudinal and survival data now have a long history of being used in clinical trials or other studies in which the goal is to assess a treatment effect while accounting for longitudinal assessments such as patient-reported outcomes or tumor response. Compared to using survival data alone, the joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data allows for estimation of direct and indirect treatment effects, thereby resulting in improved efficacy assessment. Although global fit indices such as AIC or BIC can be used to rank joint models, these measures do not provide separate assessments of each component of the joint model. In this paper, we develop a novel decomposition of AIC and BIC (i.e., AIC=AIC(Long)+AIC(Surv{\textbar}Long) and BIC=BICLong+BICSurv{\textbar}Long) that allows us to assess the fit of each component of the joint model and in particular to assess the fit of the longitudinal component of the model and the survival component separately. Based on this decomposition, we then propose AIC(Surv) and BICSurv to determine the importance and contribution of the longitudinal data to the model fit of the survival data. Moreover, this decomposition, along with AIC(Surv) and BICSurv, is also quite useful in comparing, for example, trajectory-based joint models and shared parameter joint models and deciding which type of model best fits the survival data. We examine a detailed case study in mesothelioma to apply our proposed methodology along with an extensive set of simulation studies. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In particular, for the subject-specific longitudinal evolutions we use a spline-based approach, the baseline risk function is assumed piecewise constant, and the distribution of the latent terms is modelled using a Dirichlet Process prior formulation. Additionally, we discuss the choice of a suitable parameterization, from a practitioner's point of view, to relate the longitudinal process to the survival outcome. Specifically, we present three main families of parameterizations, discuss their features, and present tools to choose between them. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates (TDC) is now a part of the standard statistical analysis toolbox in medical research. As new methods involving more complex modeling of time-dependent variables are developed, simulations could often be used to systematically assess the performance of these models. Yet, generating event times conditional on TDC requires well-designed and efficient algorithms. We compare two classes of such algorithms: permutational algorithms (PAs) and algorithms based on a binomial model. We also propose a modification of the PA to incorporate a rejection sampler. We performed a simulation study to assess the accuracy, stability, and speed of these algorithms in several scenarios. Both classes of algorithms generated data sets that, once analyzed, provided virtually unbiased estimates with comparable variances. In terms of computational efficiency, the PA with the rejection sampler reduced the time necessary to generate data by more than 50 per cent relative to alternative methods. The PAs also allowed more flexibility in the specification of the marginal distributions of event times and required less calibration. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Theories and practices regarding model estimation and fitting have been well developed for the extended PH model. However, little has been done regarding sample size calculations in survival studies involving a time-varying risk factor. A novel sample size formula based on the extended PH model is proposed by investigating the asymptotic distributions of the weighted log-rank statistics under the null and local alternative hypotheses. The derived sample size formula is an extension of the sample size formula for the standard Cox PH model. The performance of the proposed formula is evaluated by extensive simulations, and examples based on real data are given to illustrate the applications of the proposed methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

More recently, a new and attractive application of this type of model has been to obtain individualized predictions of survival probabilities and/or of future longitudinal responses. The advantageous feature of these predictions is that they are dynamically updated as extra longitudinal responses are collected for the subjects of interest, providing real time risk assessment using all recorded information. The aim of this article is two-fold. First, to highlight the importance of modeling the association structure between the longitudinal and event time responses that can greatly influence the derived predictions, and second, to illustrate how we can improve the accuracy of the derived predictions by suitably combining joint models with different association structures. The second goal is achieved using Bayesian model averaging, which, in this setting, has the very intriguing feature that the model weights are not fixed but they are rather subject- and time-dependent, implying that at different follow-up times predictions for the same subject may be based on different models.

This paper presents the capabilities of the R package JMbayes for fitting these models under a Bayesian approach using Markon chain Monte Carlo algorithms. JMbayes can fit a wide range of joint models, including among others joint models for continuous and categorical longitudinal responses, and provides several options for modeling the association structure between the two outcomes. In addition, this package can be used to derive dynamic predictions for both outcomes, and offers several tools to validate these predictions in terms of discrimination and calibration. All these features are illustrated using a real data example on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.},

	abstract = {The main advantage of longitudinal studies is that they can distinguish changes over time within individuals (longitudinal effects) from differences among subjects at the start of the study (baseline characteristics, cross-sectional effects). Often, especially in observational studies, longitudinal trends are studied after correction for many potentially important baseline differences between subjects. We show that, in the context of linear mixed models, inference for longitudinal trends is in general biased if a wrong model for the baseline characteristics is used. However, we will argue that this bias is small in most practical situations and completely vanishes in the special case of a growth curve model for complete balanced data. In the latter case, inference for longitudinal trends is completely independent of additional baseline covariates that might have been omitted from the model.},

Recent large-scale common and rare variant genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that substantially larger association studies are needed to identify most T2D loci in the population. To hasten clinical translation of genetic discoveries, new paradigms are also required to aid specialized investigation of nascent hypotheses. We argue for an integrated T2D knowledgebase, designed for a worldwide community to access aggregated large-scale genetic data sets, as one paradigm to catalyse convergence of these efforts.

	abstract = {A joint model based on a latent class approach is proposed to explore the association between correlated longitudinal quantitative markers and a time-to-event. A longitudinal latent class model describes latent profiles of evolution of the latent process underlying the correlated markers. The latent process is linked to the markers by nonlinear transformations including parameters to be estimated. A proportional hazard model describes the joint risk of event according to the latent classes and two specifications of the risk function are considered: a parametric function and a semi-parametric function based on splines. Depending on the chosen risk function, estimation is performed by a maximum likelihood or a maximum penalized likelihood approach. A simulation study validates the estimation procedure. As a latent class model relies on the strong assumption that the markers and the time-to-event are independent conditionally on the latent classes, a test of conditional independence is proposed using the residuals conditional on time-to-event. The procedure does not require any posterior classification and can be conducted using standard statistical softwares. The methodology is applied to describe profiles of cognitive decline in the elderly and their associated risk of dementia.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have shown that variation in MTNR1B (melatonin receptor 1B) is associated with insulin and glucose concentrations. Here we show that the risk genotype of this SNP predicts future type 2 diabetes (T2D) in two large prospective studies. Specifically, the risk genotype was associated with impairment of early insulin response to both oral and intravenous glucose and with faster deterioration of insulin secretion over time. We also show that the MTNR1B mRNA is expressed in human islets, and immunocytochemistry confirms that it is primarily localized in cells in islets. Nondiabetic individuals carrying the risk allele and individuals with T2D showed increased expression of the receptor in islets. Insulin release from clonal cells in response to glucose was inhibited in the presence of melatonin. These data suggest that the circulating hormone melatonin, which is predominantly released from the pineal gland in the brain, is involved in the pathogenesis of T2D. Given the increased expression of MTNR1B in individuals at risk of T2D, the pathogenic effects are likely exerted via a direct inhibitory effect on cells. In view of these results, blocking the melatonin ligand-receptor system could be a therapeutic avenue in T2D.},

In European populations, the rs1387153 T allele is associated with increased FPG ( = 0.06 mmol/l, P = 7.6 10-29, N = 16,094), type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95\% CI = 1.08–1.22, P = 6.3 10-5, cases N = 6,332) and risk of developing hyperglycemia or diabetes over a 9-year period (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.20, 95\% CI = 1.06–1.36, P = 0.005, incident cases N = 515). RT-PCR analyses confirm the presence of MT2 transcripts in neural tissues and show MT2 expression in human pancreatic islets and beta cells. Our data suggest a possible link between circadian rhythm regulation and glucose homeostasis through the melatonin signaling pathway.},

	title = {Joint {Modeling} of {Longitudinal} and {Time}-to-{Event} {Data}},
	isbn = {978-1-4398-0782-8},
	abstract = {Longitudinal studies often incur several problems that challenge standard statistical methods for data analysis. These problems include non-ignorable missing data in longitudinal measurements of one or more response variables, informative observation times of longitudinal data, and survival analysis with intermittently measured time-dependent covariates that are subject to measurement error and/or substantial biological variation. Joint modeling of longitudinal and time-to-event data has emerged as a novel approach to handle these issues.  Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data provides a systematic introduction and review of state-of-the-art statistical methodology in this active research field. The methods are illustrated by real data examples from a wide range of clinical research topics. A collection of data sets and software for practical implementation of the joint modeling methodologies are available through the book website. This book serves as a reference book for scientific investigators who need to analyze longitudinal and/or survival data, as well as researchers developing methodology in this field. It may also be used as a textbook for a graduate level course in biostatistics or statistics.},

	doi = {10.2307/2986113},
	abstract = {A model is proposed for continuous longitudinal data with non-ignorable or informative drop-out (ID). The model combines a multivariate linear model for the underlying response with a logistic regression model for the drop-out process. The latter incorporates dependence of the probability of drop-out on unobserved, or missing, observations. Parameters in the model are estimated by using maximum likelihood (ML) and inferences drawn through conventional likelihood procedures. In particular, likelihood ratio tests can be used to assess the informativeness of the drop-out process through comparison of the full model with reduced models corresponding to random drop-out (RD) and completely random processes. A simulation study is used to assess the procedure in two settings: the comparison of time trends under a linear regression model with autocorrelated errors and the estimation of period means and treatment differences from a four-period four-treatment crossover trial. It is seen in both settings that, when data are generated under an ID process, the ML estimators from the ID model do not suffer from the bias that is present in the ordinary least squares and RD ML estimators. The approach is then applied to three examples. These derive from a milk protein trial involving three groups of cows, milk yield data from a study of mastitis in dairy cattle and data from a multicentre clinical trial on the study of depression. All three examples provide evidence of an underlying ID process, two with some strength. It is seen that the assumption of an ID rather than an RD process has practical implications for the interpretation of the data.},

Loci influencing fasting insulin concentration showed association with lipid levels and fat distribution, suggesting impact on insulin resistance. Gene-based analyses identified further biologically plausible loci, suggesting that additional loci beyond those reaching genome-wide significance are likely to represent real associations. This conclusion is supported by an excess of directionally consistent and nominally significant signals between discovery and follow-up studies. Functional analysis of these newly discovered loci will further improve our understanding of glycemic control.},
